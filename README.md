_Standard AppDelegate.swift file template for Xcode 11.0+ for those who prefer the ol' reliable._ ðŸ˜Ž


## Installation:
From your terminal run:

`sh installnewtemplate.sh`

This command installs the template into your Xcode application where you'll be able to select it & use it in your projects rather than the newly `AppDelegate.swift` file that leverages the `SceneDelegate`.

_This template allows you to have the standard `AppDelegate.swift` boilerplate code from Xcode versions 10.3 & below._

## Usage :
- To use this file as your standard `AppDelegate.swift` file without the `SceneDelegate` boilerplate do the following:
  - Delete the current `AppDelegate.swift` file in your project. ðŸš«
  - Also delete the `SceneDelegate.swift` file. ðŸ—‘
  - Go to your project's `Info.plist` file and delete the `ApplicationSceneManifest`key and its 2 items. ðŸš®
  - Once you've deleted the `ApplicationManifestKey` from your project's `Info.plist`, create a new file and select your brand new AppDelegate template file. ðŸŽ‰
  - Name it `AppDelegate` in the File placeholder text within _Save As_ which you'll be saving as your brand new `AppDelegate.swift` file.  ðŸ’¾
